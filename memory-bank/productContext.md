# Product Context: Home Assistant Dashboard Backup

## Why This Project Exists
Home Assistant users invest significant time customizing their dashboards to create the perfect interface for their smart home. However, there's currently no simple way to back up these dashboards. When making changes or experimenting with new layouts, users risk losing their carefully crafted configurations. This project addresses that gap by providing a straightforward backup and restore solution.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Loss Prevention**: Prevents accidental loss of dashboard configurations during editing
2. **Experimentation Barrier**: Removes the fear of experimenting with dashboard changes
3. **Manual Backup Complexity**: Eliminates the need for users to manually locate and copy YAML files
4. **Version Control Gap**: Provides basic version control for dashboard configurations
5. **Recovery Difficulty**: Simplifies the process of recovering from unwanted changes

## How It Should Work
The solution should be intuitive and require minimal user interaction:

1. **Backup Process**:
   - User clicks a "Backup Dashboard" button on their Home Assistant dashboard
   - The component captures the current dashboard configuration in YAML format
   - The backup is saved to a designated location with a timestamp
   - User receives confirmation of successful backup

2. **Restore Process**:
   - User clicks a "Restore Dashboard" button
   - The component loads the most recent backup
   - The dashboard is restored to the backed-up state
   - User receives confirmation of successful restoration

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: One-click operation for both backup and restore
- **Transparency**: Clear feedback on backup/restore operations
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with the existing Home Assistant UI
- **Confidence**: Users feel confident making dashboard changes knowing they can easily revert
- **Accessibility**: Solution works for users of all technical skill levels
- **Minimal Configuration**: Works out of the box with minimal setup required
- **Non-disruptive**: Backup and restore operations don't interfere with normal Home Assistant operation

## Target Users
- Home Assistant enthusiasts who frequently customize their dashboards
- Users who want to experiment with dashboard layouts without risk
- Less technical users who need a simple backup solution
- Home automation professionals who maintain multiple client installations

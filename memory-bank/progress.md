## Known Issues
- Initial compatibility issue with async_get_frontend_data function has been fixed
- Potential challenges:
  - Some Home Assistant versions might have different dashboard storage mechanisms
  - UI integration might vary across different frontend versions
  - Dashboard restoration might require Home Assistant restart in some cases

## Recent Milestones
- Project initialized
- Memory Bank documentation created
- Architecture and approach defined
- Component structure implemented
- Backup and restore functionality implemented
- UI integration completed
- Documentation and HACS preparation completed
- Compatibility issues fixed

## Next Milestone Target
- Testing and refinement
- User acceptance testing
- Target date: TBD

## Development Notes
- Component structure follows Home Assistant best practices
- Backup and restore functionality uses multiple methods to access dashboard configurations for maximum compatibility
- UI integration uses a custom card that can be added to any dashboard
- Documentation includes installation instructions, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips
- Component is ready for HACS distribution
- Implemented fallbacks for functions that might not exist in all Home Assistant versions
- Enhanced error handling to gracefully handle different Home Assistant environments

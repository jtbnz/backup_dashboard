## Known Issues
- No implementation issues yet as development hasn't started
- Potential challenges identified:
  - Accessing Lovelace configuration may require research
  - Dashboard restoration might require Home Assistant restart
  - Different Home Assistant installation methods may require special handling

## Recent Milestones
- Project initialized
- Memory Bank documentation created
- Architecture and approach defined
- Component structure implemented
- Backup and restore functionality implemented
- UI integration completed
- Documentation and HACS preparation completed

## Next Milestone Target
- Testing and refinement
- User acceptance testing
- Target date: TBD

## Development Notes
- Component structure follows Home Assistant best practices
- Backup and restore functionality uses multiple methods to access dashboard configurations for maximum compatibility
- UI integration uses a custom card that can be added to any dashboard
- Documentation includes installation instructions, usage examples, and troubleshooting tips
- Component is ready for HACS distribution

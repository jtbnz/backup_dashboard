# Example configuration for adding the Dashboard Backup card to your dashboard

# First, create a directory for the examples
# mkdir -p examples

# This is an example of how to add the Dashboard Backup card to your dashboard
# You can copy this configuration into your dashboard's YAML editor

type: 'custom:dashboard-backup-card'
title: 'Dashboard Backup'
description: 'Backup and restore your dashboard configuration'
dashboard_id: 'lovelace'

# You can also customize the card further:
# 
# Example with custom title and description:
# type: 'custom:dashboard-backup-card'
# title: 'My Custom Dashboard Backup'
# description: 'Save and restore this dashboard layout'
# dashboard_id: 'lovelace'
# 
# Example for a specific dashboard:
# type: 'custom:dashboard-backup-card'
# title: 'Kitchen Dashboard Backup'
# description: 'Backup and restore the kitchen dashboard'
# dashboard_id: 'kitchen'

# Note: If the card doesn't appear in the list of available cards when adding a card to your dashboard,
# you'll need to add it as a resource first. You have two options:
#
# Option 1: Use the service to add both card versions automatically
# 1. Go to Developer Tools > Services
# 2. Select the service `dashboard_backup.add_card_resource`
# 3. Click "Call Service"
# 4. Refresh your browser
#
# Option 2: Manually add one of the card versions
# 1. Go to Configuration > Lovelace Dashboards > Resources
# 2. Click the "+" button to add a new resource
# 3. Enter one of these URLs:
#    - Standard version: `/custom_components/dashboard_backup/dashboard_card.js`
#    - Direct import version (try this if standard doesn't work): `/custom_components/dashboard_backup/dashboard_card_direct.js`
# 4. Select Resource type: "JavaScript Module"
# 5. Click "Create"
# 6. Refresh your browser
#
# If you're still seeing "Custom element not found: dashboard-backup-card" after adding the resource,
# try clearing your browser cache or using a private/incognito window.

# Active Context: Home Assistant Dashboard Backup

## Current Work Focus
We have implemented the core functionality of the Home Assistant Dashboard Backup component. The current focus is on:

1. Testing the component in different Home Assistant environments
2. Refining the user experience
3. Preparing for distribution via HACS
4. Gathering user feedback for future improvements

## Recent Changes
- Created project documentation in the Memory Bank
- Defined project requirements and goals
- Outlined system architecture and technical approach
- Identified key technologies and dependencies
- Implemented the core component structure
- Created the backup and restore functionality
- Developed the UI integration with a custom card
- Prepared documentation and HACS configuration
- Fixed compatibility issues with different Home Assistant versions:
  - Added fallback for missing async_get_frontend_data function
  - Enhanced dashboard configuration access methods
  - Improved error handling in restore functionality
  - Added alternative frontend registration methods
- Enhanced custom card implementation:
  - Updated to use LitElement for better compatibility
  - Improved card registration with multiple fallback methods
  - Added detailed documentation for manual resource addition
  - Created service for adding card as a resource

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Test the component in different Home Assistant environments
   - Test with different dashboard configurations
   - Test with different Home Assistant installation methods
   - Verify compatibility with various Home Assistant versions

2. Refine the user experience
   - Improve error handling and user feedback
   - Enhance notification messages
   - Optimize performance

3. Prepare for distribution
   - Finalize documentation
   - Create example configurations
   - Prepare for HACS submission

4. Plan future enhancements
   - Multiple backup support
   - Backup browser UI
   - Scheduled backups

### Future Enhancements
- Multiple backup support (not just the latest backup)
- Backup naming and descriptions
- Scheduled automatic backups
- Backup browser and selection UI
- Export/import functionality for sharing configurations

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Storage Location
- Implemented a configurable backup path with a default location in Home Assistant's configuration directory
- Users can change this location through the integration configuration

### Backup Format
- Storing backups as raw YAML files for maximum compatibility and transparency
- Using timestamped filenames for version tracking

### UI Integration Approach
- Implemented a custom card (dashboard-backup-card) that provides backup and restore buttons
- Card is configurable with custom title, description, and dashboard ID

### Error Handling Strategy
- Using Home Assistant's notification system for user feedback
- Detailed error logging for troubleshooting
- Event firing for integration with automations

### Dashboard Access Method
- Implemented multiple methods to access dashboard configurations for maximum compatibility:
  1. Direct access through the lovelace component
  2. Reading from .storage directory
  3. Accessing through frontend data
  4. Reading from YAML configuration files

### Component Configuration
- Minimal configuration with just a backup path option
- Focus on simplicity and ease of use

### Compatibility Considerations
- Added fallbacks for functions that might not exist in all Home Assistant versions
- Implemented multiple methods for accessing and updating dashboard configurations
- Enhanced error handling to gracefully handle different Home Assistant environments
- Provided alternative methods for frontend integration

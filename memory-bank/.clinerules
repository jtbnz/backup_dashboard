# Cline Rules: Home Assistant Dashboard Backup

## Project Patterns

### Naming Conventions
- Component name: `dashboard_backup`
- Service names: `dashboard_backup.create_backup`, `dashboard_backup.restore_backup`
- File naming: Use timestamps for backup files (e.g., `dashboard_20250519_144530.yaml`)
- Directory structure follows Home Assistant custom component conventions

### Code Style
- Follow Home Assistant's Python style guidelines
- Use async/await for all I/O operations
- Include type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Document all functions and classes with docstrings

### Development Workflow
- Document changes in Memory Bank before implementation
- Update progress.md after completing each phase
- Test thoroughly before moving to the next phase
- Keep code modular and focused on single responsibilities

## Project Intelligence

### Home Assistant Integration
- Custom components live in `custom_components/` directory
- Components must register with Home Assistant during setup
- Services are registered during component initialization
- UI elements are added through Lovelace resources and cards

### Dashboard Configuration
- Lovelace dashboards can be configured via YAML or UI
- Dashboard configurations are stored in `.storage/lovelace*` files
- Accessing dashboard configurations requires understanding Home Assistant's internal APIs
- Changes to dashboards may require reloading the Lovelace configuration

### User Preferences
- Focus on simplicity and ease of use
- Minimize configuration requirements
- Provide clear feedback for all operations
- Ensure compatibility with different Home Assistant setups

## Known Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- Accessing and modifying Lovelace configurations may require undocumented APIs
- Dashboard restoration might require special handling to apply changes
- Different Home Assistant installation methods may have different file paths

### User Experience Challenges
- Users may expect multiple backup support
- Clear error messages are essential for troubleshooting
- Users may want more control over backup location and naming

# Technical Context: Home Assistant Dashboard Backup

## Technologies Used

### Core Technologies
- **Python 3.9+**: Primary programming language for Home Assistant components
- **YAML**: Configuration format for Home Assistant and dashboards
- **Home Assistant Core API**: For interacting with Home Assistant services and configurations
- **Lovelace UI**: Home Assistant's dashboard system that we'll be backing up and restoring

### Frameworks & Libraries
- **Home Assistant Component Framework**: For creating custom components
- **Home Assistant Frontend**: For UI integration
- **PyYAML**: Python library for YAML parsing and generation
- **Voluptuous**: Schema validation library used by Home Assistant
- **aiohttp**: Asynchronous HTTP client/server for Python

## Development Setup

### Local Development Environment
- Python 3.9+ with virtual environment
- Home Assistant development instance
- Visual Studio Code with Python and Home Assistant extensions
- Git for version control

### Development Workflow
1. Set up a development instance of Home Assistant
2. Create custom component in `custom_components/dashboard_backup/`
3. Test component functionality in the development instance
4. Package component for distribution

### Testing Environment
- Local Home Assistant instance with test dashboards
- Multiple dashboard configurations for testing different scenarios
- Automated tests for component functionality
- Manual UI testing for user experience

## Technical Constraints

### Home Assistant Constraints
- Must follow Home Assistant component structure and conventions
- Must be compatible with Home Assistant's async programming model
- Should work with Home Assistant versions 2021.12.0 and newer
- Must respect Home Assistant's security model and permissions

### System Constraints
- Should work across different Home Assistant installation methods (Core, Supervised, HAOS, Container)
- Must handle limited storage environments (e.g., Raspberry Pi installations)
- Should have minimal impact on Home Assistant performance
- Must handle network interruptions gracefully

### Security Constraints
- Should not expose sensitive information in logs
- Must validate all user inputs
- Should handle file permissions appropriately
- Must not introduce security vulnerabilities

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Home Assistant Core (2021.12.0 or newer)
- Python 3.9 or newer
- PyYAML 6.0 or newer

### Internal Dependencies
- Access to Home Assistant's Lovelace configuration
- Permission to read/write files in Home Assistant's configuration directory
- Access to Home Assistant's notification system

## Installation Requirements
- Custom component directory in Home Assistant configuration
- HACS (Home Assistant Community Store) compatibility for easy installation
- Minimal configuration requirements for users

## Deployment Considerations
- Component should be installable via HACS
- Documentation should include installation instructions
- Component should handle upgrades gracefully
- Should provide clear error messages for troubleshooting

## Performance Considerations
- Backup operations should be quick and non-blocking
- File operations should be optimized for limited resources
- Should handle large dashboard configurations efficiently
- UI operations should remain responsive during backup/restore

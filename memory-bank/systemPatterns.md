# System Patterns: Home Assistant Dashboard Backup

## System Architecture
The Home Assistant Dashboard Backup solution follows a modular architecture that integrates with Home Assistant's existing systems:

    User[User] -->|Interacts with| UI[Dashboard UI]

    Component -->|Interacts with| HA[Home Assistant Core]
    HA -->|Provides| Config[Dashboard Configuration]
    Component -->|Updates| UI
```

## Key Components

### 1. Custom Component (`dashboard_backup`)
- Core functionality module registered with Home Assistant
- Provides services for backup and restore operations
- Handles file operations and error management
- Manages configuration and integration setup

### 2. Services
- `dashboard_backup.create_backup`: Captures and saves the current dashboard configuration
- `dashboard_backup.restore_backup`: Restores the dashboard from the most recent backup
- Services are exposed to Home Assistant for triggering via UI or automations

### 3. Storage Management
- Stores backups in a dedicated directory within Home Assistant's configuration directory
- Uses timestamped filenames for version tracking
- Implements file rotation to manage storage usage

### 4. UI Integration
- Custom buttons added to the dashboard via Lovelace cards
- Notification system for operation feedback
- Simple configuration via YAML or UI

## Design Patterns

### 1. Service Pattern
- Component exposes well-defined services to Home Assistant
- Services have clear inputs and outputs
- Operations are atomic and transactional

### 2. Repository Pattern
- Abstracts storage operations from business logic
- Handles file I/O, naming conventions, and retrieval

### 3. Observer Pattern
- Component listens for service calls
- Notifies Home Assistant of operation results
- Updates UI based on operation outcomes

### 4. Facade Pattern
- Simplifies complex Home Assistant API interactions
- Provides a clean interface for dashboard operations

## Data Flow

### Backup Process
```mermaid

    participant User
    participant UI as Dashboard UI
    participant Service as Backup Service
    participant Component as Backup Component
    participant HA as Home Assistant Core
    participant Storage as File Storage
    
    User->>UI: Click Backup Button
    UI->>Service: Call dashboard_backup.create_backup
    Service->>Component: Process backup request
    Component->>HA: Request current dashboard config
    HA->>Component: Return dashboard YAML
    Component->>Storage: Save YAML with timestamp
    Storage->>Component: Confirm save
    Component->>UI: Display success notification
```

### Restore Process
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI as Dashboard UI
    participant Service as Restore Service
    participant Component as Backup Component
    participant HA as Home Assistant Core
    participant Storage as File Storage
    
    User->>UI: Click Restore Button
    UI->>Service: Call dashboard_backup.restore_backup
    Service->>Component: Process restore request
    Component->>Storage: Request latest backup
    Storage->>Component: Return backup YAML
    Component->>HA: Update dashboard config
    HA->>Component: Confirm update
    Component->>UI: Display success notification
    HA->>UI: Refresh dashboard
```

## Technical Constraints
- Must work within Home Assistant's component architecture
- Should not modify core Home Assistant files
- Must handle different dashboard configurations (YAML and UI-configured)
- Should be compatible with various Home Assistant installation methods
- Must respect Home Assistant's security model
